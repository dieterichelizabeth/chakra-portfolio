# Chakra Portfolio 🍏🍐🥝

[View the Deployed App](http://dieterichelizabeth.github.io/chakra-portfolio)

This project is another remake of my portfolio, this time using the wonderful Chakra UI! I had the pleasure of using Chakra templates on a previous project- [Food Truck Finder](https://github.com/JFlo1981/FoodTruckFinder)- and highly recomment it, especially if mobile responsiveness is important for you!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), and [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).
